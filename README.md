I honestly donâ€™t know how to answer your first question but I hope that, as a young pirate who is first time aboard a ship, 
I would find a more experienced pirate who would advise me, in the beginning, so I could come up with 
something new and innovative soon. 

The second task (a and b part) took me about 10-12 minutes. 

The third task took me a bit more time, about 30 minutes.
